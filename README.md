# KnowItOwl

80% of the data at large enterprise customers is unstructured and represents huge untapped potential. My teammates and I saw the challenge they faced in utilizing the expansive knowledge of unstructured documents accumulated over decades because of a lack of indexing and the natural language they used. My solution is Know It Owl (KIO), a user-facing chatbot that employes BERT, a machine learning model at its core.
